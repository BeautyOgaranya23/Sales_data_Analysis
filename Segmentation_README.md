## Methodology
###Tools Used
1. **Microsoft Azure SQL** 
2. **Excel**
3. **PowerBI** 

###Data Analysis Process
1. **Data Collection and Cleaning**
Used SQL to clean and preprocess the data:
Applied `JOIN` statements to combine data from different tables, ensuring a comprehensive dataset.
Utilized `CASE` statements to handle missing values and standardize categorical variables.
Implemented `IF` statements to create new derived columns based on conditional logic.
Ensured data consistency and integrity through various SQL queries.

2. **Data Manipulation and Analysis**
Employed SQL `JOIN` statements to integrate data from various sources, forming a unified view of customer activities and attributes.
Calculated RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) scores for each customer:
  Recency: The time since the customer's last purchase.
  Frequency: The total number of purchases made by the customer.
  Monetary: The total monetary value of the customer's purchases.
Used `CASE` statements to assign scores for each RFM component.
Combined RFM scores to segment customers into distinct groups.
